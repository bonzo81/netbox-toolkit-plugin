# API Reference

The NetBox Toolkit Plugin provides a comprehensive REST API for network device command execution and management. The API offers **complete feature parity** with the web interface and includes **additional capabilities** not available through the GUI, making it ideal for automation, integration, and advanced workflows.

## Key Advantages of the API

ðŸš€ **Enhanced Capabilities Beyond GUI:**
- **Bulk Operations**: Execute multiple commands across multiple devices simultaneously
- **Advanced Statistics**: Comprehensive execution analytics and reporting
- **Flexible Export**: Multiple formats with advanced filtering options
- **Programmatic Validation**: Pre-validate variables without execution
- **Integration Ready**: Perfect for automation workflows and third-party integrations

âœ… **Complete Feature Parity:**
Every feature available in the web interface is fully accessible via API, ensuring consistent functionality across all access methods.

## Quick Start

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using NetBox's token system:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://netbox.example.com/api/plugins/toolkit/commands/
```

### Base URL

All API endpoints are prefixed with:
```
/api/plugins/toolkit/
```
